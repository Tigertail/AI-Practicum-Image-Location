# AI-Practicum-Image-Location-Prediction
An AI that can guess which of several cities an image is from. This project was created as part of a Cornell University class, CS 4701: Practicum in Artificial Intelligence.

This contains the code for two different AI approaches, a Convolutional Neural Networt (CNN) and a Wide Residual Network (WideResNet). Using the training file, we trained the two AI's on 5000 images from Google Street View API for 10 different epochs to guess the location of an image from 1 of 5 selected cities (Munich, Santiago, Rio de Janeiro, Austin, and Tokyo). After training, the CNN had a validation rate of 93.55%, while the WideResNet had a validation accuracy of 91.25%, contrasted with the human recognition rate of 55.55%.
